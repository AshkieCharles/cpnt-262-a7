## Search Queries
### Search Topic One (Components and Props)
The thing that I was trying to look for was components and props to use for svelte kit as I could hardly understand looking through the notes, but it was easier when I see it being done in front of me.

1. [Components and Props for svelte kit](https://www.google.com/search?q=Components+and+Props+for+svelte+kit&oq=Components+and+Props+for+svelte+kit&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIKCAQQIRgWGB0YHjIKCAUQIRgWGB0YHtIBBzQ1M2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
  - From there I was able to find a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v943IElHCeY) and the [documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components) for components and props.
  - Useful Keywords: Components, Props, Svelte Kit
  


### Search Topic Two (Import and Export)
For the second one I was trying to look for was a tutorial on why my javascript file import was being read but had no value to it. It took me a couple of hours to figure out I had used the wrong syntax to pull the values from the imported js array of objects.

1. [How to import Js into a svelte kit component](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+import+js+into+a+svlete+kit+component&oq=how+to+import+js+into+a+svlete+kit+component&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCwgAEEUYChg5GKABMgkIARAhGAoYoAHSAQkxODIzN2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
 - I was able to find a [youtube shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FGSEmGEP_78) that solved my problems from importing the javascript file.

  - I shortened the search term using only the main keywords.
